## Android Trivia

The Android Trivia application is an application that asks the user trivia questions about Android
development. It makes use of the Navigation component within Jetpack to move the user between
different screens. Each screen is implemented as a Fragment. The app navigates using buttons, the
Action Bar, and the Navigation Drawer.
