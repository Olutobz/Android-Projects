    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Olutoba.
        \nI love swimming and playing video games.
        \nThe kind of games I play are Call Of Duty, Fifa and Pes football games and NBA2k.
        \nFun fact is that I am very skilled at video gaming.
        \nI like eating food, too. Chicken. Grilled Fish. Smoked fish. Yam &amp; eggs - not so much.
        \nAnd sometimes I even go for a workout at the gym.
        \nAnd even less sometimes, I actually go for a jog.
        \nOnce, when I was travelling to lagos in Nigeria, and very hungry, I even had
        to checkout a mall and eat.
        \nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to swim efficiently.
        \nYou should ask someone else about swimming, though.\n\n
